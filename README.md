Chrysalis Firmware Bundle
=========================

This is a collection of sketches for all the boards [Chrysalis][chrysalis]
supports. These are the "Factory Firmware" sketches Chrysalis offers to flash.
All of them are based on the layout the keyboards usually ship with, but built
with [Kaleidoscope][kaleidoscope], and with enough support for Chrysalis to
work.
